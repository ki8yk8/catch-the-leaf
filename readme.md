# Catch the Leaf
The project is a game where player is able to move a basket to catch the falling leafs. But, there are some difficulties ahead;
1. If 5 leafs touches the ground, you die.
2. As game progresses, speed of leaf spawning increases,
3. You will be greeted with fires and if you catch them, sorry your 10 points are gone.

And here are some helpful features for you;
1. You get a additional life every 17 seconds. Be sure not to miss that.
2. Every 10 leafs caught, your levels get increased and after every 5 levels, you get stream of leafs in same position to help you upgrade the level.
3. **COOL THING ALERT** If you live for at least 33 seconds, you get a magnet friend for 10 seconds and I think you guessed it, magnet attracts only leaf in this game.
